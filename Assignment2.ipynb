    "### 1. What is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples.\n",
    "Ans. It is a process of getting knowledge, skills, seeing and understanding human behaviours. 2 examples are when we see a car and attach the term 'car', we learn that the word car refers to a particular object which drives on road and from human actions we learn how to greet someone.\n"

    "Ans. Yes there are many forms of learning like you learn from past data or experience and also from seeing this which helps us distinguish.There are machine learning equivalents like we have computer vision which can learn from seeing or observing things, we have machine learning algorithms which learns from past data."

    "Ans. There is a agent which are trained on a reward and punishment mechanism where agent is rewarded for performing correct decision or action and punished when it takes wrong action or moves. As a result, the agent tries to minimize wrong moves and maximize the right ones."

    "### Q.Explain Concept Learning?\n",
    "Ans. It will help us in finding all consistent hypothesis(imagination) or the concepts. So we have different hypothesis having different concepts. For eg: Universe which has all the gadgets. General representation of concept = <x1,x2,x3,x4> Eg: Tablet = <size,color,screentype,shape> => <large,black,flat,Square>. No.of possible instances = 2^d where d is no.of features = 2^4=16\n",
    "So, Now total no of concepts = 2^2d= 2^16. You would be choosing some concepts from 2^16 which u have receievd. We choose only the concept which are consistent all the time those type of concept will be considered.Like from entire gadgets we only took tablets and smartphone whereas gadgets includes many things right!which is called as target space/hypothesis space. You assumed these features will get added without having contradictions in later stage."

    "Ans. Classification is a type of problem  where it categorizes a set of data into different classes. The main difference between classification and regression is, Regression we create a best fit line where many data points lie near or on the line whereas in classification it tries to draw a best fit line in the middle of datapoints which are seperated.

It tries to build relations with the independent variables. I solved Car Price Prediction problem where i calculate price of a car based on the inputs provided by the client. "
