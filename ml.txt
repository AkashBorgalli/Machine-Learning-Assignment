1.	What type of Machine Learning Algorithms would be used to allow your bipedal bot to walk in various terrains?
Ans: I would use Reinforcement learning, Custom Vision techniques for a bot to walk in various terrains.
2.	What is the difference between online learning and out-of-the-core learning?
Ans: Online learning is type of learning system where machine learns from small chunks of continuous streaming data.
3.	What is the importance of a train-dev set in machine learning?
Ans: It helps us to figure out whether our model is overfitted or it has some data mismatch
4.	If suppose your model is poorly generalizing the unseen data, what possibilities are there, and how you will solve those situations?
Ans: This problem we term as overfitting, so to generalize we can go         for cross validation techniques. You can for Regularization , post, pre pruning techniques so it best generalise on the data.
5.	What is data leakage and what can go wrong if you tune your hyperparameters on the test set?
Ans:  Data Leakage happens when your validation and Testing set is not representative meaning it has some missing data. If u apply hyperparameters on test data than that data would be seen and then it wonâ€™t give u the actual accuracy.
