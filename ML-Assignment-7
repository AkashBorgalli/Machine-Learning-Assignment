## Assignment 7

1. How sci-kit learn module performs feature scaling?

Ans:

2. If you are performing feature scaling, what you will prefer Standardisation or Normalization?

Ans: Depends what kind of data we are bringing to the scale if its numeric or tabular dataset i would go with Standarization so i quickly reach global minima using GD Algorithm whereas if i m working on images there i need to convert image range from 0 to 255 there i will use normalization. 

3. What is the difference between the residual sum of squares and regularization?

Ans:

4. Differentiate between L1, L2, and Elastic Net regularization on the basis of the alpha parameter in scikit learn?

Ans:

5. Suppose overfitting is happening, what kind of regularization you will prefer to perform?

Ans:
